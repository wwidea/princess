       * Fine Tuning Label Height
       * ------------------------
       * Do not rely on the 'published' label size from the manufacturer. It's
       * been 'rounded off' for marketing purposes. The precise number you need,
       * measured in inches, likey extends out several decimal places to the right.
       * 
       * For instance, Avery(R) 5390 'Name Tags' have a marketed height of 2.25in.
       * For your purposes here, the correct height is about 2.2083in. 
       * 
       * The easiest way to fine tune label height for a new label format is...
       * 
       * 1. Generate a pdf of sample data that will fill one page of labels, and count
       * the number of rows on the page (no need to actually print it, yet).
       * 
       * 2. Count the number of rows on the generated page.
       * 
       * 3. Repeat steps 3a and 3b below, gradually diminishing the adjustment until
       *    you are satisifed that the measurement is abolutely perfect... then repeat
       *    steps 3a and 3b 10 more times.
       *    
       *   a. If the number of rows is **equal to or greater than** the number
       *   that should actually appear on the page, slightly increase the height
       *   (in small increments) until you have **one less** than the correct
       *   number of rows. Then, reduce the amount of change, and do step 3b.
       *   
       *   b. If the number of rows is **less** then the number that should appear
       *   on the page, slightly decrease the height (in small measuremnts)
       *   until you have exactly the right number of rows. Then, reduce the
       *   amount of change, and do step 3a.
       * 
       * 4. After you have printed several sheets of real data with your new template
       *    and are thoroughly satisified that your dimensions are perfect, send your
       *    template file to this plugin's admins so that we can include it for the
       *    benefit of other users.
